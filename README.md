### What are **Digital Currencies** and **Altcoins**:
- Digital currency is a type of currency available only in digital form, not in physical form like, banknotes, coins, or other fiat currencies. 
- Digital currencies exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but allows for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer-of-ownership. Examples include virtual currencies and cryptocurrencies or even central bank issued "digital base money". 
- Like traditional money, these currencies may be used to buy physical goods and services, but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game or social network
