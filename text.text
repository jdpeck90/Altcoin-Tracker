### Tech

Altcoin Tracker uses a number of open source projects to function properly:
- [Express] - node.js network app framework
- [Pg-promise] - Handles callbacks and promises for Postgress Databases.
- [Mustache-express] - Makes express compatiable with Mustache.
- [Body-parser] - Parses through Database data and displays desired data through req.body
- [Express-session] - middleware that lets us have a session on express 
- [Bcryptjs] - password hashing module written in pure javascript  
- [Method-override] - This module allows us to use HTTP verbs like DELETE & PUT in places where the client doesnâ€™t support it.
- [JQuery] - DOM manipulation, API calls, & CSS animations. 
Ajax this is part of the JQuery library and is used to make API calls. 
Javascript is the primary language I used to write this program.
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend   
- [D3.js] - Graph to come  
- [materialize] - ui boilerplate
